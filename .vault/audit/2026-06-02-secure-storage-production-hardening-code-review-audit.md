# `secure-storage-production-hardening` Code Review

## S49-001 | PASS | Final SecureStorage W06.P11 review found no findings

Reviewer `Beauvoir` completed the final `W06.P11.S49` SecureStorage review across the `S45` through `S48` commit set, step records, audit records, and scoped implementation/test files.

No findings were reported. The review verified that runtime-bound repositories fail closed for missing, stale, expired, or unsecured active sessions; locale-backed error keys are present; exceptions derive from AEAT storage/core bases; and the new tests avoid fakes, mocks, stubs, monkeypatches, skips, xfails, naked environment mutation, and mirrored business logic.

Closure assessment: `W06.P11.S49` can close based on the reviewed evidence. Live Google Drive mirror and formula-level calc-sheets proof remains separately tracked by the open `W06.P11.S428` through `W06.P11.S431` rows and is not claimed by this closeout.
