# `cross-domain-continuity` audit: `persona-fleet round 7`

## Scope

Fifth sequential persona-fleet audit round for the cross-domain-continuity campaign.
Five personas exercised the CLI end-to-end: two round-6 repeats (Pere Rosselló,
Marc Carrasco Vidal), one round-6 repeat for entity work (Joan Marí Vidal), and two
fresh personas (Inés Ortega Castell as S.A., Anna Pérez García as trabajador
asalariado). Method: CLI-only, isolated `AEAT_LOCAL_STORAGE_ROOT`, no live rights,
each persona's declared `--output-language`. Primary objectives: verify closure of
Cluster D, W02.P12, W03.P14, W03.P15, and W01.P07 regressions; surface new
defects for S37 plan expansion.

## Per-persona findings

### Pere Rosselló — pensioner, landlord, capital gains, Catalan

**Cluster T — STILL PRESENT (CRITICAL)**

`aeat app modelo calculate` on Modelo 100 with a €27 000 pension + rental base returns
`cuota_íntegra = 0` and `mín_personal = 0`. The personal-data binding block (NIF, age,
family situation) feeds the mín_personal deduction path; without it the cuota collapses
to zero. The same defect was observed on round-6 and has not closed. Root cause: Modelo
100 revision 2024 is missing the personal-data binding declarations that are present in
revision 2025. This is an M100 2024 TOML authoring gap, not an engine defect.

**R7-A — ledger list/view validation failure on CSV with empty currency field**

`aeat app ledger import` accepts a CSV row where the `currency` column is empty. The
import succeeds. A subsequent `aeat app ledger list` or `aeat app ledger view` on the
resulting entry raises a validation error. The import boundary accepts what the query
boundary rejects: the boundary contract is asymmetric. Step S219 scope.

**R7-B — CCAA enum crash on verify — CLOSED**

`aeat app modelo verify` raised `ValidationError` on CCAA enum values. Closed by S218
(enum fix). Verified absent in this round.

**R7-C — pre-profile language fallback uses Spanish, not system locale**

Before a profile is created, `aeat` commands that require a profile and receive
`--output-language ca` fall back to Spanish prose rather than Catalan. The locale
resolution path does not honour the CLI flag when no profile storage root is yet
initialised. Step S220 scope.

**R7-D — calculation-result labels remain Spanish regardless of `--output-language`**

`aeat app modelo calculate --output-language ca` returns a JSON payload where the
human-readable label fields (casilla names, section headings) are in Spanish. The locale
flag is honoured by error messages but not by the calculation-result renderer. Step
S221/S222 scope.

---

### Joan Marí Vidal — SL, intracomunitario, Catalan

**W02.P12 — CLOSED.** Modality wiring for SL entities verified correct this round.

**W03.P14 — CLOSED.** Modelo 200 pyme bracket returns 25% for INCN > €1M, 23% below.
Correct per LIS Art. 29 and the round-7 TOML backfill.

**W03.P15 — CLOSED.** Casilla normalisation (`--casilla` bare numeric token) verified
working.

**R7-001 — M200 verify enum crash — CLOSED**

Same S218 enum fix closes this. Verified absent.

**R7-002 — file refusal message in English**

`aeat app modelo file` refusal (safety gate: `AEAT_LIVE_TESTS_ENABLED` not set) emits
English prose regardless of `--output-language ca`. The refusal text cites an
environment-variable name and a class name in raw engineering English. Locale parity
gap on the file-refusal path. Step S223/S224 scope.

**R7-003 — Modelo 202 accepts period `1T` at create then fails calculate**

`aeat app modelo create --modelo 202 --period 1T` succeeds and returns a revision ID.
`aeat app modelo calculate` on that revision then fails with a period-format error.
The create boundary accepts the `1T` token; the calculate boundary rejects it. The two
commands have divergent period validation. Step S225/S226 scope.

---

### Inés Ortega Castell — S.A., Spanish (fresh)

**S227 — CRITICAL: M200/M202 absent from overview calendar despite `explain=applicable`**

`aeat app overview` returns an empty calendar for M200 and M202 for a freshly created
S.A. profile. `aeat app modelo explain --modelo 200` returns `applicable = true` with
correct deadline windows. The overview calendar and the applicability engine disagree.
A normal operator relies on the calendar as the authoritative task list; it silently
omits the two most significant IS obligations.

**S228 — CRITICAL: profile-fact key namespace divergence**

`aeat config profile set` accepts keys in the `profile.` namespace (e.g.
`profile.entity_type`). The applicability engine and overview query the `entity.` and
`fiscal.` namespaces. The same fact written under `profile.entity_type` does not resolve
when queried as `entity.type`. Two namespaces for the same data: the operator's write
path and the engine's read path are disconnected. Profile configuration silently produces
no effect on applicability or overview output.

**S229 — locale parity gap on calendar output**

`aeat app overview --output-language es` renders some deadline descriptions in English
(specifically the IS deadline window descriptions). The locale key coverage for the
overview calendar is incomplete.

**S230 — Modelo 303 mensual SII path broken**

`aeat app modelo create --modelo 303 --regime sii --period 2024-01` fails with
`KeyError` on a regime-specific binding key. The SII (Suministro Inmediato de
Información) path for M303 mensual is not exercised by the standard quarterly path and
has a binding-resolution gap.

**S231 — `--retencion-observation` arg validation error is misleading**

`aeat app modelo calculate --modelo 115 --retencion-observation X` where `X` is not a
valid observation code emits a raw Python `ValueError` rather than a structured CLI
error with the accepted values listed. The validation path for this argument does not
route through the CLI error boundary.

**S232 — `config profile` locale parity**

`aeat config profile list --output-language es` returns field labels in English for the
`entity_type` and `fiscal_year_start` columns. Locale coverage gap in the profile
display path.

**S233 — backlog token notation inconsistency: `2026Q1` vs `1T`**

`aeat app modelo backlog` lists pending obligations using `2026Q1` notation.
`aeat app modelo create` documentation and help text uses `1T` notation.
`aeat app ledger import` uses `1T`. The three surfaces cannot agree on a period token
format. This is the period-unification residual: W01.P07 closed the parse layer but did
not normalise display output across all surfaces.

---

### Marc Carrasco Vidal — autónomo IT, Catalan (round-6 repeat)

**Cluster D — CLOSED.** Boolean canonical form (`true`/`false` in TOML, not `1`/`0`)
verified correct this round.

**W01.P07 — CLOSED.** Period token unification verified: `1T`, `2024T1`, `2024Q1` all
parse to the same internal period across create/calculate/verify.

**W03.P15 — CLOSED.** Casilla normalisation verified.

**Cluster T — STILL PRESENT (CRITICAL)**

Same as Pere Rosselló: `cuota_íntegra = 0` on Modelo 100 with a non-zero IRPF base.
M100 revision 2024 missing personal-data bindings. Confirmed as the same root cause.

**R7-D1 — ledger classify/list/view silent profile gate**

`aeat app ledger classify`, `list`, and `view` require a configured profile but silently
return empty results rather than emitting a "no profile configured" diagnostic.
The create and import verbs do raise a clear error; the query verbs do not. Parallel to
round-5 auth surface finding (silent failure vs explicit error).

**R7-D2 — `StoredCalculationDriftError` not registered in error-code registry**

`aeat app modelo work` (import-side) raises `StoredCalculationDriftError`. The error
propagates through the CLI boundary as an unhandled exception because
`StoredCalculationDriftError` has no registered `ErrorCode` entry and the
`command_error_boundary` broad `AeatError` arm does not reach it before the raw
traceback surfaces. Identical to Anna D1 below; confirmed as a cross-persona blocker.

**R7-D3 — `bindings list` without filters returns wrong revision**

`aeat app modelo bindings list --modelo 130` without `--period` or `--revision`
arguments returns the binding list for an unexpected revision (observed: 2025 revision
returned for a 2024 fiscal-year profile). The default revision selection in the bindings
query path does not respect the profile's active fiscal year.

**R7-D4 — `ledger import --period` token format inconsistency**

`aeat app ledger import --period 2024T1` fails. `aeat app ledger import --period 1T`
succeeds. The ledger import path does not feed the unified period parser introduced in
W01.P07. It has its own local string check. W01.P07 closure is incomplete for this verb.

---

### Anna Pérez García — trabajador asalariado, Spanish (fresh)

**D1 — CRITICAL: `StoredCalculationDriftError` not registered — import-time crash**

`aeat app modelo work` (any invocation) raises `StoredCalculationDriftError` as an
unhandled exception immediately on import when a stored revision's registry fingerprint
no longer matches the current registry. The error class is a subclass of `AeatError` but
has no `ErrorCode` entry. The CLI boundary's `StoredProfileDriftError` arm catches
`StoredProfileDriftError` specifically; `StoredCalculationDriftError` falls through to a
raw traceback. All `aeat app modelo work` invocations are blocked for this persona. This
is the same defect as R7-D2 above.

**D2 — Cluster T: `cuota_íntegra = 0` on €38k base, `mín_personal = 0`**

Fresh trabajador asalariado profile, M100 revision 2024, `base_liquidable_general`
set to €38 000. `cuota_íntegra = 0`, `mín_personal = 0`. Same root cause as Cluster T
across the other personas: M100 revision 2024 TOML missing personal-data binding
declarations. The IRPF tariff table lookup is not reached because the mín personal
deduction reduces the effective base to zero before the tariff applies.

**D3 — `iva.regime` defaults to `GENERAL` for natural person profiles**

A fresh natural-person profile receives `iva.regime = GENERAL` as the default. A
trabajador asalariado who is not a VAT-registered operator should not have an IVA
obligation surfaced at all. The default assignment does not gate on `entity_type` or
`actividad_economica` presence.

**D4 — wizard non-TTY hint incomplete**

`aeat config profile create` in a non-interactive context (pipe, CI) exits with a hint
that reads "run in a TTY to use the wizard" but does not explain how to supply the
required fields non-interactively via flags. A first-time operator in automation cannot
proceed.

**D5 — revision should be derivable from fiscal year**

`aeat app modelo calculate --modelo 100 --revision 2024` requires the operator to know
and supply the revision identifier. The profile carries `fiscal_year = 2024`. The
calculate command should resolve the correct revision from the profile fiscal year
without an explicit `--revision` flag. The gap forces every operator to know the
revision-to-year mapping, which is registry-internal knowledge.

## Cross-persona pattern analysis

### Cluster T — cuota=0 on non-zero IRPF base (3 personas, CRITICAL)

Pere Rosselló (M100, €27k pension base), Marc Carrasco Vidal (M100, autónomo base),
and Anna Pérez García (M100, €38k asalariado base) all observe `cuota_íntegra = 0`
and `mín_personal = 0`. The engine produces a zero cuota because the mínimo personal y
familiar deduction (Art. 56-61 LIRPF) is evaluated at zero, which reduces the
`base_liquidable` inputs to the tariff below zero before the table is consulted.
Root cause: Modelo 100 revision 2024 TOML does not declare the personal-data binding
block (NIF, age, family-unit size, disability degree) that is present in revision 2025.
Without those bindings the mínimo personal computation silently returns zero. Tracked
by the W04 Steps introduced for Cluster T (see plan).

### `StoredCalculationDriftError` unregistered — import crash (2 personas)

Marc Carrasco Vidal (R7-D2) and Anna Pérez García (D1) both hit the same unhandled
`StoredCalculationDriftError` exception. The class is a domain error subclass but has
no `ErrorCode` registration. The CLI `command_error_boundary` catches
`StoredProfileDriftError` by name but does not catch `StoredCalculationDriftError`
before the broad fallback. Every operator whose stored revision fingerprint diverges
from the current registry is blocked. Steps S234/S235 scope.

### Ledger query-verb silent failure (2 personas)

Pere Rosselló (R7-A: validation error on list/view after import with empty currency)
and Marc Carrasco Vidal (R7-D1: silent empty results on classify/list/view without
profile) both experience ledger query verbs that accept bad state silently instead of
emitting a structured error. The import boundary and the query boundary have divergent
validation contracts. Step S236 scope.

## Recommendations for plan expansion (S37)

The following Steps are recommended for addition to the plan under S37. Each
recommendation carries the finding IDs it resolves.

**CRITICAL tier — block verificado_completo and calendar paths:**

- S227: Reconcile overview calendar with applicability engine — M200/M202 absent from
  calendar despite `explain=applicable`. Root: calendar query does not consult
  applicability engine output; both must share the same authority. (Inés S227)

- S228: Unify profile-fact key namespace — write path (`profile.*`) and read path
  (`entity.*`, `fiscal.*`) must resolve the same keys. Define the canonical namespace
  and migrate all read paths to it. (Inés S228)

- S234/S235: Register `StoredCalculationDriftError` in the error-code registry and add
  it to the `command_error_boundary` arm before the broad `AeatError` fallback. (Marc
  R7-D2, Anna D1)

**MAJOR tier:**

- S219: Fix ledger import/query boundary asymmetry — CSV rows with empty `currency`
  must be rejected at import, not at query. (Pere R7-A)

- S220: Honour `--output-language` in pre-profile CLI paths — locale flag must apply
  before profile storage is initialised. (Pere R7-C)

- S221/S222: Extend calculation-result renderer to respect `--output-language` —
  casilla labels and section headings must be localised. (Pere R7-D, Joan R7-002
  partial)

- S223/S224: Localise file-refusal message — cite `AEAT_LIVE_TESTS_ENABLED` gate
  first, never raw environment-variable or class names, honour `--output-language`.
  (Joan R7-002)

- S225/S226: Unify M202 period validation between create and calculate — accept `1T`
  in both or reject in both. (Joan R7-003)

- S236: Emit structured error from ledger classify/list/view when no profile is
  configured — parallel to the already-correct create/import behaviour. (Marc R7-D1)

- S237/S238: Wire `ledger import --period` through the unified period parser from
  W01.P07 — close the incomplete coverage of W01.P07. (Marc R7-D4, Inés S233 partial)

**MINOR tier:**

- S229: Fill locale keys for overview calendar IS deadline descriptions. (Inés S229)

- S230: Fix M303 mensual SII binding-resolution gap. (Inés S230)

- S231: Route `--retencion-observation` validation through CLI error boundary with
  accepted-values list. (Inés S231)

- S232: Fill profile display locale keys for `entity_type` and `fiscal_year_start`
  columns. (Inés S232)

- S233/S237: Normalise period token display across backlog, create help, and ledger
  import to a single canonical notation. (Inés S233)

- S238/S239: Fix `iva.regime` default — do not assign `GENERAL` to profiles without
  `actividad_economica` flag. (Anna D3)

- S239: Improve wizard non-TTY hint to include non-interactive flag usage. (Anna D4)

- D5: Resolve `--revision` from profile fiscal year when flag is absent. (Anna D5)
