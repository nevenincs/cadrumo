# `calculation-truth-registry` Code Review

No blocking issues were found in the invoice row-index alignment slice.

The previous row resolver shape used zero-based indexes, which did not match
the filing draft schema or export renderer. The resolver now emits one-based
indexes and the row-binding tests assert the public contract directly.

Verification recorded:

- `uv run pytest src/aeat/domain/calculations/registry/test_invoice_bindings.py -q`
- `uv run ty check src/aeat/domain/calculations/registry/_bindings.py src/aeat/domain/calculations/registry/test_invoice_bindings.py`
- `uv run ruff check src/aeat/domain/calculations/registry/_bindings.py src/aeat/domain/calculations/registry/test_invoice_bindings.py`
- `git diff --check -- src/aeat/domain/calculations/registry/_bindings.py src/aeat/domain/calculations/registry/test_invoice_bindings.py`
