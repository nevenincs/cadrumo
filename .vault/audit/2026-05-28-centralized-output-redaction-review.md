# `centralized-output-redaction` Code Review

No HIGH/CRITICAL findings in the scoped S01 implementation.

## Scope

- `src/aeat/core/redaction/__init__.py`
- `.vault/plan/2026-05-28-centralized-output-redaction-plan.md`
- `.vault/exec/2026-05-28-centralized-output-redaction/2026-05-28-centralized-output-redaction-W01-P01-S01.md`

## Findings

- None (all reviewed behavior remained aligned with this step’s stated target: canonical CLI redaction constants/helpers and placeholder policy).

## Residual risks

- `redact_structured_for_cli_output` currently collapses any UUID-shaped string (including non-profile/bucket/object UUIDs) to `CLI_PROFILE_ID_PLACEHOLDER`; this is privacy-safe but could increase output ambiguity for operators in non-sensitive debug paths.
- `cli.diagnostics.profile` / `cli.diagnostics.secure_objects` still emit raw values directly in this step (they are intended for later W02 migration), so centralized redaction is not yet effective for those surfaces until migration steps are implemented.

## W01.P01.S02 Review

No HIGH/CRITICAL findings in the scoped S02 implementation.

### Residual risks

- This step introduces output-policy enums/tables but does not yet wire enforcement call sites, so effective privacy behavior remains unchanged until downstream output rendering/log/error migration steps execute.
- `persisted_as` mappings (`LOG`/`ERROR`→`SensitivityClass.AUDIT`, `DIAGNOSTIC`→`SensitivityClass.DIAGNOSTIC`, `CLI_PUBLIC`→`None`) are coherent, but current policy reuse means call sites that only consume `redaction_rules` without the CLI key-aware placeholder helper can still miss profile/bucket/object-field normalization.
