# `assets-core` audit: `Integrated assets-core review`

## Scope

Reviewed Phase P01 across the accepted lifecycle decision, its code/reference
grounding, the current amortization-routing regression, inventory separation,
execution evidence, and the transition into the persisted schedule work. Source
commits reviewed: `d50d31373a`, `33b7c8492d`, and `376669fb66`.

## Findings

### phase-01 | low | unsafe full-cost routing remains intentionally pinned

The regression correctly proves that an unscheduled acquisition still reaches
casilla 0208 at full base. This is evidence for the P03 collision fix, not a
supported outcome. The accepted atomic-delivery boundary prevents the future
asset persistence or API from being presented as complete until resolver and
filing ownership land with it.

Result: PASS. No critical or high findings.

## Recommendations

Retain the regression unchanged through P02. In P03, add the positive scheduled
charge and scoped competing-claim refusal before replacing the unsafe behavior.
Do not weaken the test to make an intermediate backend slice appear complete.
