# `profile-password-custody` audit: `storage and custody green sweep`

## Scope

A green-sweep of the storage, custody, secure-enrolment and profile-management
surfaces at HEAD after the per-profile password cutover, covering the backend
and the CLI, plus the residue the cutover left behind. Driven by the operator
goal of a verified profile lifecycle rather than by a plan row.

## Findings

### Four defects the cutover left at HEAD, all repaired

A wrong-package import of the snapshot-namespace constant in the profile
repository test module broke COLLECTION of the entire `user_profile` test
package. The constant has never been defined in the domain package it was
imported from; the sibling roundtrip module already imported it from its real
home. A whole package's coverage was silently unrunnable.

The setup-event emission gate still declared the wizard persistence adapter as
the emission site for the profile-values-updated event after the profile-fact
write door was relocated out of the wizard. The emission itself was alive and
correct at the new home, carrying the door payload key. This is a relocation
whose consumer sweep missed a gate, which the atomic-relocation discipline
exists to prevent.

The live IVA wallet test had the retired shared-master-key provider wrapper
mechanically swapped for the EPHEMERAL provider. That provider opens a throwaway
bucket session under a random key, so the block bound every read and write to an
ephemeral bucket while the test asserts against the operator's real active
profile. It also tripped the ephemeral-key storage hygiene gate. The canonical
sibling live test carries no key-provider wrapper at all, which is the
current-model shape. A mechanical rename during a teardown is not a semantic
substitution: the wrapper had to be deleted, not re-pointed.

Two public callables shared the name for exporting a recovery artifact -- the
application door taking an enrolment record, and the substrate narrowing that
door wraps. The package facade mapped the name to the SUBSTRATE one while every
other member of the recovery family mapped to the application module, so the
application door was unreachable through its own facade, and two live consumers
had already diverged on which signature the shared name meant. A duplicate
public name does not announce itself; it splits its consumers first.

### The scripted profile-create verb carried a dead arm

The create verb had two arms and only one worked. The bare form reached the
credential registration door; any invocation carrying profile field flags was
routed back to the setup flow, whose create arm refuses outright before it
validates anything. The flagged form was therefore a dead end -- and the
operator-action catalogue projects exactly that flagged invocation as the
recovery for a clean-root refusal, so the projected recovery could never
succeed. An agent operator following the projected action had nowhere to go.

The routing was justified on the grounds that the flow is where those values are
validated and that handling them at the door would drop them silently. That
concern was real, so the repair kept the validation and dropped the routing: the
flags are projected through the flow's own canonicalisation and handed to the
registration door, which had always accepted initial facts. The projection is
pure and runs before the passphrase is resolved, so a refused flag costs the
operator no prompt and leaves no capsule to undo.

### A guard that looked redundant was carrying the message, not the rule

The explicit foral-regime refusal in that projection appeared to duplicate the
CCAA question's own widget validator, and a first version of the new regression
passed with the guard removed. Removing it does still refuse -- but as a generic
wizard-validation failure instead of the domain refusal naming the Concierto
Economico and the foral tax office the operator actually has to file with.

The lesson generalises past this guard: a check that shares an outcome with a
deeper validator is not thereby redundant, because the OUTCOME is not the only
thing an operator receives. Asserting only that a run refused is what made the
case vacuous; asserting the specific refusal code is what made it bite.

### The tree-wide blocker is not in this domain

Every remaining failure in the profile and storage lanes shares one external
cause: the registry authority refuses to load while six modelo revisions claim
filing authority grade with families still blocked pending evidence. It cascades
into any test that needs a snapshot.

This also re-blocks the deferred carry-forward for the setup-incomplete
anti-tautology confirmation, and that row's blocker has CHANGED IDENTITY: the
missing corpus sidecar it was last attributed to has since been authored, and
what remains is the authority-grade tail. The surface belongs to the registry
temporal-coverage campaign, which is actively landing per-modelo closures, so it
is routed rather than absorbed.

### Recovery enrolment at creation is delivered at the CLI door

The enrolment mint is wired into the create transaction ahead of publication,
with the 24 words delivered through the handover channel BEFORE the capsule is
published, so a channel that cannot deliver aborts creation rather than leaving
an enrolled profile whose only key went nowhere. The CLI door passes a handover
and carries dedicated coverage. The outstanding deferral is narrower than the
row's wording suggests: it is the full-screen creation door only, whose
terminal-direct channel cannot render inside the full-screen display.

## Recommendations

Treat the storage substrate package named for the retired shared-master-key
model as the next scoped effort rather than an incidental cleanup. It now houses
the LIVE per-profile session substrate -- bucket sessions, the login throttle,
KDF parameters, idle timeout -- under a package name describing a model the
cutover retired, and it still exports a provider protocol with roughly ten
consumers outside the package plus an unsecured-provider implementation with
about five. Some of that is genuine retired-provider residue; some is protective
code that merely carries a legacy name, such as the refusal that stops a real
profile being opened on an unsecured backend. Classifying those apart is the
work, and a name-driven deletion would remove a safety guard. A rename is a
relocation and must land atomically with every consumer.

Do not treat the profile-rename and profile-duplicate capabilities as pending.
They exist in neither backend nor CLI, and the operator has ruled them out of
scope on the reading that profile names are stable, which is the norm elsewhere.
Recorded so a later reader does not re-derive them as a gap: the label is
written only at capsule creation and has no in-place rewrite path, and
duplication would require a new identity, a new data-encryption key and a full
re-encryption, since the key is per-profile and its rotation is unsupported.
