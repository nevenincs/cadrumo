     Scope list are all filled by `vaultspec-core vault add exec` from the

# Retire the 5 counterpart_bindings re-export(s) from the registry bindings dispatch module by direct-importing CounterpartAggregationObservation, CounterpartObservationRequirement, counterpart_binding_requirements, resolve_counterpart_binding_row_values, resolve_counterpart_binding_values from their defining module at every production, test, fixture, annotation, tooling and dynamic consumer, delete the corresponding __all__ entries and import block, and prove zero remaining reach through the dispatch module for those symbols.

## Scope

- `src/cadrumo/domain/calculations/registry/counterpart_bindings.py`
- `src/cadrumo/domain/calculations/registry/bindings.py`
- `and every consumer of the listed symbols under src/`
- `dev/ and docs/`

## Changes

- `M` `src/cadrumo/domain/calculations/registry/bindings.py`
- `verify:` `uv run --no-sync pytest src/cadrumo/domain/calculations/registry/tests/test_counterpart_bindings.py -q -m unit` -> `pass` (19 passed)

<!-- MECHANICAL LOG. One line per path touched, nothing else:
       `A path` added   `M path` modified   `D path` deleted   `R old -> new` renamed
     Paths are repo-relative, in backticks. No prose, no sentences, no
     narration of intent, outcome, or difficulty - the diff and the plan Step
     already carry those. Example:

       - `M` `src/vaultspec_core/cli/exec_cmd.py`
       - `A` `src/vaultspec_core/cli/tests/test_exec_cmd.py`
       - `D` `src/legacy/shim.py`

     Optional final line, only when a check was run:
       - `verify:` `<command>` -> `pass` | `fail`

     Optional `## Notes` section, ONLY on exception: data loss, skipped work,
     a scaffold left in code, or a persistent failure. Omit it otherwise -
     an absent section is correct; an empty one is a check finding. -->

## Notes

validate_counterpart_binding, imported from the same counterpart_bindings.py module, stays: it is a genuine dispatch-table entry for BindingSourceKind.LEDGER_TRANSACTION, not in __all__, out of this Step's named scope.
