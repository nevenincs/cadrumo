# Invoice Roundtrip Gate

## Scope

C4 ledger invoice unification reconciliation record for $(System.Collections.Hashtable.Step).

## Description

- Reconcile the already-landed unified invoice implementation against the approved C4 plan.
- Verify the relevant code and tests through focused C4 gates.
- Leave the AggregationSourceKind.INVOICE retirement chain open because registry consumers remain live.

## Outcome

The combined business invoice CLI and business operation invoice tests passed in the C4 verification sweep.

## Notes

Verified with invoice application, operator-surface, business invoice CLI, business operation invoice, documented command, and JSON schema conformance tests. Registry-wide collection remains blocked by unrelated peer registry and wizard refactor errors.
