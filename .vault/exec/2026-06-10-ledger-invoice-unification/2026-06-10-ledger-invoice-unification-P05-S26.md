# Invoice List No-Kind Guard

## Scope

C4 ledger invoice unification reconciliation record for $(System.Collections.Hashtable.Step).

## Description

- Reconcile the already-landed unified invoice implementation against the approved C4 plan.
- Verify the relevant code and tests through focused C4 gates.
- Leave the AggregationSourceKind.INVOICE retirement chain open because registry consumers remain live.

## Outcome

`test_invoice_list_without_kind_returns_both_kinds` verifies the bare list path returns both source kinds.

## Notes

Verified with invoice application, operator-surface, business invoice CLI, business operation invoice, documented command, and JSON schema conformance tests. Registry-wide collection remains blocked by unrelated peer registry and wizard refactor errors.
