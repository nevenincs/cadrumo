# Run canonical strict production type checking at the Wave 1 handoff

## Scope

- `justfile check-types and dev/quality/types.py`

## Changes

- `M` `.vault/plan/2026-09-09-facts-registry-plan.md`
- `A` `.vault/exec/2026-09-09-facts-registry/2026-09-09-facts-registry-W01-P23-S43.md`
- `verify:` `just check-types` -> `fail`

## Notes

The boundary command reports 50 existing `ty` diagnostics outside the facts-registry surfaces; `pyrefly` and `basedpyright` report zero diagnostics. No Wave 1 facts path appears in the detailed output.

<!-- MECHANICAL LOG. One line per path touched, nothing else:
       `A path` added   `M path` modified   `D path` deleted   `R old -> new` renamed
     Paths are repo-relative, in backticks. No prose, no sentences, no
     narration of intent, outcome, or difficulty - the diff and the plan Step
     already carry those. Example:

       - `M` `src/vaultspec_core/cli/exec_cmd.py`
       - `A` `src/vaultspec_core/cli/tests/test_exec_cmd.py`
       - `D` `src/legacy/shim.py`

     Optional final line, only when a check was run:
       - `verify:` `<command>` -> `pass` | `fail`

     Optional `## Notes` section, ONLY on exception: data loss, skipped work,
     a scaffold left in code, or a persistent failure. Omit it otherwise -
     an absent section is correct; an empty one is a check finding. -->
