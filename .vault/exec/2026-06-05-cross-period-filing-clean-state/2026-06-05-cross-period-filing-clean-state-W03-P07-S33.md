# `cross-period-filing-clean-state` `W03.P07.S33` exec - Renta payment-source clean-state requirements

## Description

Verified Renta payment-source aggregation is included in the filing-grade clean-state workflow coverage.

## Outcome

The workflow enforcement test covers Modelo 100 and asserts filing is refused when its upstream payment-source declarations are not clean.

## Notes

The test path is `src/aeat/application/modelo/tests/test_cross_period_clean_state_enforcement.py` and uses real work units, calculation revisions, and repositories.
