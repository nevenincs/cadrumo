<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #exec) and one feature tag.
     Replace cli-authority-verb-conformance with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.

     modified: CLI-maintained last-modified stamp; set at scaffold time,
     refreshed by mutating CLI verbs and vault check fix; never hand-edit.

     step_id is the originating Step's canonical identifier, e.g. S01.
     The S157 and 2026-07-15-cli-authority-verb-conformance-plan placeholders are machine-filled by
     `vaultspec-core vault add exec`; do not fill them by hand.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar-plan]]' and link the
     parent plan.

     DO NOT add fields beyond those scaffolded; metadata lives
     only in the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

- `src/cadrumo/entrypoints/mcp/tests/test_write_policy_mutability_parity.py` placeholders below are machine-filled
     by `vaultspec-core vault add exec` from the originating Step row;
     do not fill them by hand. -->

# Assert MCP mutability distinguishes read-only status from destructive operations

## Scope

- `src/cadrumo/entrypoints/mcp/tests/test_write_policy_mutability_parity.py`

## Description

- Run the MCP mutability-parity gate and confirm read-only status is distinguished from destructive operations.

## Outcome

The named gate passes and holds the mutability projection in parity with the write policy, keeping the read-only and destructive distinction intact across the two surfaces. The distinction is the same one the reset lifecycle relies on, where status is a read while start and resume are destructive.

## Notes

No code change was required by this Step. The implementing change had already landed under the successor plans this document was rescoped into, so the row was stale rather than unexecuted. The Step is closed as verified-satisfied against its named surface, per the Wave W06 instruction that each open W05 Step be verified against that surface before being checked and never inferred from the live command tree alone.
