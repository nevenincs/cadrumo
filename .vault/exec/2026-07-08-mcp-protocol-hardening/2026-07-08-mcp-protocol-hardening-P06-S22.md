# Add telemetry retention tests proving pruning bounds growth and never touches the newest sessions

## Scope

- `src/aeat/entrypoints/mcp/tests/test_serving_gates.py`

## Description

- Implemented as part of the P06 (retention and posture) phase; the executed action is the plan step named in the heading above.

## Outcome

- Executed and merged in commit `5c591e7734` (feat(mcp): classification table, toolset activation, input-schema fidelity, boundaries, retention). Green in the current mcp suite (241 passed) at reconciliation time.

## Notes

- Exec record backfilled by reference on 2026-07-10 during the P04 result-thinning reconciliation: this step was executed and landed by the commit(s) above before per-step exec records were authored for phases P01-P03 / P05-P06. The backfill changed no code; it records the existing landing so the plan closes with execution evidence per the plan-closure-requires-exec-records discipline.
