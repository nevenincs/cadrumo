<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #exec) and one feature tag.
     Replace m303-form-vs-semantic-casilla-dual-keying with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.
     step_id is the originating Step's canonical identifier, e.g. S01.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[YYYY-MM-DD-foo-bar-plan]]' and link the
     parent plan.

     DO NOT add frontmatter fields
     outside the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

<!-- STEP RECORD:
     This file represents one Step from the originating plan. Identified
     by its canonical leaf identifier (S##) and ancestor display path. -->

# Implement the equality-operator branch in the predicate evaluator so the consistency predicate returns True iff the box value equals its semantic source value

## Scope

- `src/aeat/application/modelo/_verification_actions.py`

## Description

- Implement the `equals` branch in the predicate evaluator `_evaluate_predicate_expression` in `src/aeat/application/modelo/_verification_actions.py` (real evaluator: holds iff lhs == rhs; missing reads as Decimal(0); defensive on malformed arity).
- Add the `_PREDICATE_EQUALS` regex and re-export it from `_actions.py` so the operator-parity gate test can reach it.

## Outcome

- Step landed; focused gates green (registry M303 load, verification-substance operator parity, the M303 official-box projection suite).

## Notes

- The DSL-operator edits touch `_schema.py` and `_verification_actions.py`, which carried concurrent peer WIP (a DT-12 advisory extraction). The edits are additive and in disjoint regions; the working tree is internally consistent and all focused tests pass.
