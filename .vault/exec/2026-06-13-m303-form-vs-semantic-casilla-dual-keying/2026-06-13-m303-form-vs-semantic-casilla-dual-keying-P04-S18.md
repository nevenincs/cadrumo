<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #exec) and one feature tag.
     Replace m303-form-vs-semantic-casilla-dual-keying with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.
     step_id is the originating Step's canonical identifier, e.g. S01.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[YYYY-MM-DD-foo-bar-plan]]' and link the
     parent plan.

     DO NOT add frontmatter fields
     outside the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,

# Narrow the deducible implies_any_nonzero advisory predicate to drop populated constituents (29/33 and 37 if wired) and keep it firing only for any box left manual (e.g. 37 if deferred)

## Scope

- `src/aeat/_data/registry/aeat/modelos/303/revisions/2023-y-siguientes/verification_expectations/0001-verification_predicates.toml`

## Description

- Retire the deducible implies_any_nonzero advisory predicate: ALL its constituents (29/33/37) are now computed projections (box 37 wired to AIC-deducible, not deferred).
- The calculate-path advisory reads these same predicates, so retiring them narrows the calculate advisory in lock-step.

## Outcome

- Step landed; focused gates green (registry M303 load, verification-substance operator parity, the M303 official-box projection suite).

## Notes

- The DSL-operator edits touch `_schema.py` and `_verification_actions.py`, which carried concurrent peer WIP (a DT-12 advisory extraction). The edits are additive and in disjoint regions; the working tree is internally consistent and all focused tests pass.
