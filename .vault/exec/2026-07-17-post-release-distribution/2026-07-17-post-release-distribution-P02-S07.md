<!-- FRONTMATTER RULES:
     tags: one directory tag (hardcoded #exec) and one feature tag.
     Replace post-release-distribution with a kebab-case feature tag, e.g. #foo-bar.
     Additional tags may be appended below the required pair.

     modified: CLI-maintained last-modified stamp; set at scaffold time,
     refreshed by mutating CLI verbs and vault check fix; never hand-edit.

     step_id is the originating Step's canonical identifier, e.g. S01.
     The S07 and 2026-07-17-post-release-distribution-plan placeholders are machine-filled by
     `vaultspec-core vault add exec`; do not fill them by hand.

     Related: use wiki-links as '[[yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar-plan]]' and link the
     parent plan.

     DO NOT add fields beyond those scaffolded; metadata lives
     only in the frontmatter. -->

<!-- LINK RULES:
     - [[wiki-links]] are ONLY for .vault/ documents in the related: field above.
     - NEVER use [[wiki-links]] or markdown links in the document body.
     - NEVER reference file paths in the body. If you must name a source file,
       class, or function, use inline backtick code: `src/module.py`. -->

<!-- STEP RECORD:
     This file represents one Step from the originating plan. Identified
     by its canonical leaf identifier (S##) and ancestor display path.

# DONE, macOS Python row green in run 29657832151 after root-causing the deterministic per-binary Keychain hang via the worker-stack capture (custody file-backend pin b5e6780fb1, product follow-up issue 615)

## Scope

- `.github/workflows/packaging-smoke.yml`

## Description

- Run the cohort-bound installed-behavior oracle on the claimed macOS Python row in real CI.
- Root-cause and fix the deterministic per-binary Keychain hang blocking the macOS leg.

## Outcome

The macOS Python row is green in the same run `29657832151` (commit `1abbc48c72`, in HEAD) after root-causing the deterministic per-binary Keychain hang via the worker-stack capture and pinning the custody file backend at commit `b5e6780fb1` (in HEAD). The residual macOS-native custody concern is tracked as product follow-up issue `615`. Closed against a real green CI run.

## Notes

Retroactive execution record; step already checked. The custody file-backend pin is an accepted mitigation with a named product follow-up, not a silenced failure. Vault-only bookkeeping.
