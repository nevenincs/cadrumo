# add encrypted persistence support for wallet observations

## Scope

- `src/aeat/adapters/outbound/aeat/sede/_observation_store.py`

## Description

- Reconciled this historical checked plan row to a canonical per-step exec record.
- Verified the row remains checked in `2026-05-19-live-iva-compensation-wallet-plan` at HEAD.
- Preserved the plan row, source tree, and prior exec/audit artifacts unchanged.

## Outcome

`vaultspec-core vault add exec` created this record with a `step_id` matching the checked row. The implementation evidence is the current checked plan row plus the feature source, tests, and audits already referenced by that row and its scope; this pass repairs traceability for `plan-closure-requires-exec-records` only.

## Notes

No new code, live AEAT access, plan checkbox change, source kind, resolver convention, or validator convention was introduced. The standing open live verification row `W06.P15.S56` remains separate and is not closed by this reconciliation.
