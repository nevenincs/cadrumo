# add inline comment in _command_matches_current confirming attachment_ids equality is value-equal not identity-equal

## Scope

- `pydantic-frozen collection safety note`
- `Wave-1 audit FU-E`
- `src/aeat/application/ledger/_actions.py`

## Description

- Reconciles the checked historical S207 row against the direct evidence named in the related reconciliation audit.
- Adds no production-source change.

## Outcome

- Restores the one-Step/one-record traceability edge for this historical checked row.
- The related audit names the exact supporting audit, execution record, or commit evidence.

## Notes

- This record asserts no new implementation or re-run verification; it records evidence reconciliation only.
