# `restructure-execution` adr: `warning closeout authority alignment` | (**status:** `accepted`)  ## Problem Statement  The vault lifecycle checks reported this feature as having execution records or a plan without an explicit same-feature ADR authority record. That weakens semantic discovery because developer briefings can find work evidence without a local decision anchor.  ## Considerations  This ADR is a curation alignment record, not a new implementation mandate. It preserves historical execution context while giving the feature a stable decision node for vault health and semantic search.  ## Constraints  The pass is vault-only. No application code, tests, registry data, or runtime behavior is changed. Body wiki-links are avoided; frontmatter related fields carry the required navigation edges.  ## Implementation  Treat the linked research record as the evidence bridge for this warning closeout. Existing plans and execution records remain historical sources; this ADR exists so the feature has an explicit authority node.  ## Rationale  A same-feature ADR avoids warning-level ambiguity in the vault graph and reduces the risk that future agents brief from orphaned execution records without an authority source.  ## Consequences  Feature lifecycle checks can resolve a local ADR for this feature. Later feature-specific decisions may supersede this curation ADR if they update frontmatter links on plans, research, and indexes.  ## Codification candidates  No project rule is promoted from this warning closeout record.
