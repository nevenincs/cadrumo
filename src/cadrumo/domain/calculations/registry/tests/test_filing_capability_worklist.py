"""The standing worklist of modelos this application cannot yet file.

THIS TEST IS EXPECTED TO FAIL, AND MUST NOT BE MADE TO PASS BY NARROWING IT.

A permanently-failing test is normally forbidden by this project's quality rules.
This one is sanctioned by explicit operator directive, and it exists because the
previous arrangement was worse: every modelo that could not emit a filing artifact
carried a decision record declaring its layout withdrawn, each individually
grounded and defensible, and nothing ever summed them. The tree stayed green while
the application quietly could not file IVA, sociedades or retenciones. Converting
"we cannot file this" into a declared, gate-satisfying state is precisely what let
that go unnoticed for the whole of the project's history.

So the absence is now loud instead of ratified. The failure message below is the
capability worklist: every modelo and revision that cannot produce a filing
artifact, sorted and counted. It goes green when, and only when, every revision in
the registry can emit -- at which point the list is empty and this test passes on
its own, with no edit.

Forbidden, without exception:

* Do not skip, xfail, or mark this test.
* Do not narrow it to a subset of modelos, add an allowlist, or excuse
  "informative" modelos.
* Do not hardcode the expected list. It is derived from the registry on every run,
  so a modelo that gains a layout leaves the list automatically and one that loses
  a layout rejoins it. A hardcoded tally would rot into a stale claim, which is the
  same failure mode in a new costume.

The one legitimate way to change this test's result is to build an export layout.

    Capability is read exactly as the filing boundary reads it: layouts are derived
    from bindings first, so a revision declaring none inline but deriving one counts
    as capable and never appears here. That keeps this worklist and the refusal in
    :mod:`.._snapshot` from ever disagreeing about who is on the list.

    The tree is read through the compiler rather than the validated authority on
    purpose. A worklist that can only be produced when the registry is healthy is
    useless precisely when it is needed: any unrelated validation failure anywhere
    in the tree would replace this enumeration with someone else's error, and the
    list of modelos that cannot file would silently stop being reported.
